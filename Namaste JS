Javascript : Everything in JS happens inside execution context.

Execution context has 2 components :
1. Memory component (Variable Environment)
2. Code component (Thread of execution)

Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language.
-> Single Threaded : Execute one command at a time
-> Synchronous : Every statement of the code gets executed one by one where execution doesnot move to new line until it finishes current line of code. It only sends single request at a time.
